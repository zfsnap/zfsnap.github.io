zfsnap is already packaged for many OSs and distributions â€” FreeBSD and Debian
(Jessie) in particular. We always recommend that you check your package manager
first.

If zfsnap isn't packaged for your OS yet, or you want the bleeding-edge code,
then you can easily get it from our `respository on GitHub`_.
