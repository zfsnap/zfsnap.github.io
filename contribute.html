<h1>want to contribute?</h1>
<p><em>Awesome.</em> Development primarily takes place on <a href="https://github.com/zfsnap/zfsnap">
   GitHub</a>. Fork the repo, create a branch, hack in your feature, and send
   us a Pull Request.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, just email our mailing list (zfsnap@librelist.com).</p>
<p>If you found a bug, please report it via our <a href="https://github.com/zfsnap/zfsnap/issues">
   issue tracker on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>We ask that you take the time to read the following developer notes so that
   your patches are more likely to be accepted.</p>

<h2>Developer Notes</h2>
<p>zfsnap is written in sh, avoiding bash-, ksh-, etc-specific features. Good
   old, simple sh. Though don't despair, it's surprisingly powerful.</p>

<h3>Portability</h3>
<p>Portability is key. When in doubt, if it isn't defined in POSIX, then don't
   use it. Exceptions are made (such as the choice to use "local" variables),
   but are rare.</p>
<p>Thankfully, ZFS is relatively modern (it was first introduced in Solaris 10),
   so the shells supported are comparatively featureful and complete.</p>
<p>OS checks are frowned upon; please keep the code as platform agnostic as
   possible.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>As a rule, avoid calling external programs (date, grep, sed, etc). Adding a
   call or two per run isn't a problem, but adding a call that will execute for
   every snapshot checked will cause major slowdowns. Remember, zfsnap runs on
   systems with 100,000+ snapshots to check. sh's substring support is powerful
   enough that sed and grep are rarely (if ever) needed in our use-case.</p>
<p>Also avoid spawning subshells, which are almost as bad as calling external
   programs. <code>$()</code>, <code>``</code>, and <code>|</code> each invoke
   subshells; if you need to return a value from a function, use the global
   variable <code>RETVAL</code>.</p>

<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>When submitting a patch, it is infinitely more likely to be accepted if it
   comes with tests.</p>

<h3>References</h3>
<p>Man pages are usually the best source of information when it comes to
   features and portability. sh's man page for any given OS is usually
   available <em>somewhere</em> on the internet.</p>
<p>The book "Beginning Portable Shell Scripting From Novice to Professional" is
   also a great reference, and has proven to be invaluable at times. It focuses
   on portability across Bourne and Bourne-like shells.</p>
